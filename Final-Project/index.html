    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Thomas SANKARA:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1949</strong> - Born in Yako</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1972</strong> - During his studies in Madagascar, he assisted to the revolution that 
        led to the end of Philibert Tsiranana 's regime .This leads him to conceive the idea of 
        a “democratic and popular revolution”.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1973</strong> - Back in Upper Volta with the rank of second lieutenant, he was assigned to the training of young recruits. He stood out for his conception of military training in which he included teaching on the rights and duties of the citizen, insisting on the political training of soldiers: "without patriotic political training, a soldier is only a potential criminal” , he used to say.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1974</strong> - He distinguished himself militarily during the war with Mali , which gave him national fame. Captain, he then created a clandestine organization with other officers, got closer to far-left militants and did a lot of reading 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1980</strong> - A military coup takes place in november but the new mode, although popular, is shown quickly repressive and binds the army to scandals
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1982</strong> - A new coup brought military doctor Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo to power . Later, the latter will ensure that the coup had been prepared for the sole benefit of Thomas Sankara but that the latter had declined the offer at the last moment. He had therefore been chosen, against his will, because he was the most senior officer in the rank of commander
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1983</strong> - Sankara becomes Prime Minister People's Salvation Council (CSP), a position acquired thanks to the balance of power favorable to the progressive camp within the army [7] . He openly comes out in favor of breaking the “neocolonial” relationship that binds Upper Volta to France: “When the people stand up, imperialism trembles. The imperialism watching us is worried. He is shaking. Imperialism wonders how it can sever the link that exists between the CSP [the government] and the people. Imperialism trembles. He trembles because here in Ouagadougou, we are going to bury him
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1985</strong> - Several African regimes close to Paris organized an attempt to destabilize Burkina Faso in order to favor the overthrow of Thomas Sankara. The Malian regime of President Moussa Traoré , supported by Côte d'Ivoire and Togo, circulated rumors attributing border violations to Burkinabe soldiers and went to war for a few weeks with Burkina Faso. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) notes in a cable that “The war was born out of Bamako's hope that the conflict would trigger a coup d'etat in Burkina Faso
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1986</strong> - A cooperation program with Cuba is set up. After meeting Fidel Castro , Thomas Sankara sends young Burkinabés in Cuba so that they can follow professional training and participate in the development of the country upon their return. The latter must be volunteers and are recruited on the basis of a competition with priority given to orphans and children from rural and disadvantaged areas. Some 600 teenagers thus flew to Cuba to complete their schooling and follow professional training in order to become doctors, engineers, agronomists or even gynecologists
      </li>
      <li><strong>1987</strong> - Assassinated on October 15.</li>
    </ul>

        "The debt is still the neo-colonialists or the colonizers who have transformed themselves into technical assistants. In fact, we should say who turned into technical assassins. And they are the ones who offered us sources of financing, donors, a term that we use every day as if there were men whose yawn was enough to create development in others. These donors have been advised and recommended to us. We were presented with tempting financial arrangements, files. We got into debt for fifty years, sixty years and even more. That is to say, we have been led to compromise our peoples for fifty years and more."
